# Lineage 2 API

A read-only HTTP API over Lineage 2 datapack content — items, NPCs, drops,
spawns, recipes, skills, and armor sets — built with Next.js (App Router)
and served from generated JSON. Chronicle is part of every URL path so
additional chronicles can be added without endpoint changes.

## What's in the box

- **Items** — full detail with combat stats, weapon/armor properties,
  resolved item skill (description + parsed effects), and Special Ability
  (SA) variants for A/S-grade weapons including the `+5% PvP Damage`
  engine rule.
- **NPCs** — both a **cleaned** layer (one record per unique name,
  drops + spawns aggregated across merged ids) and a **raw**, source-faithful
  layer for callers who need engine-level fidelity. Detail responses
  carry an optional `primaryRegion` derived from the NPC's spawns.
- **Monsters** — filtered view over the NPC dataset; same cleaned/raw
  split, same `primaryRegion` enrichment.
- **Drops** — enriched with item names, deduped on `(npcId, itemId, min,
  max, chance)`, and reverse-indexed: every item carries `dropped-by` and
  `spoiled-by` lookups.
- **Spawns** — coordinates per NPC, deduped across merged ids. Cleaned
  spawn endpoints attach a resolved `region: RegionRefDto | null` per
  row (raw endpoints stay unenriched).
- **Recipes** — exposed inline on item-detail responses (`crafting` for
  recipe scrolls, `craftedBy` for products).
- **Skills** — full catalog with resolved descriptions, parsed `<for>`
  effects (literal + `<table>` references), and icon files; consumed
  inline by item / NPC / class detail.
- **Armor sets** — full catalog endpoint plus embedded set context on
  every piece (`partOfSets[]`).
- **Classes** — all 89 Interlude player classes (base + 1st/2nd/3rd
  profession), with full skill-learn tables, spellbook references, and
  parent/child cross-links. Spellbook items reverse-link to the skills
  they teach and the classes that learn them.
- **Commerce** — merchant `buyLists` (Adena-for-item) and a curated set
  of multisell exchanges (Mammon, B-grade unseal, Luxury Shop, Apella).
  Surfaced both per-NPC at `/npcs/[id]/shop` and per-item via `soldBy`,
  `exchangeFrom`, and `exchangeFor` cross-links.
- **Quests** — full catalog (329 on Interlude) plus per-quest detail
  with rewards, involved NPCs/monsters, quest items, and race/class
  gates extracted from aCis Java scripts. When the L2 client's
  `questname-e.dat` is present, also surfaces the `description` flavor
  prose and `clientJournalEntries` (the player's in-game quest log
  entries — short title + prose + completion NPC per step). Honestly
  framed as the client journal, not an editorial walkthrough.
  Cross-linked from item / NPC detail (`rewardedByQuests`,
  `questItemFor`, `startsQuests`, `involvedInQuests`). On items the
  reward link carries the per-quest count and includes Adena (item
  57) via the engine-special `q.rewards.adena` scalar.
- **Regions** — full catalog of 19 named map regions (Talking Island
  Village, Town of Aden, …) sourced from upstream `mapRegions.xml`.
  These are engine "death-teleport" regions, not biome polygons —
  `primaryRegion` reads as "the in-game town this NPC is associated
  with" rather than "this NPC's biome label".
- **Locations** — full catalog of 209 player-facing hunting / map
  locations (Cruma Tower, Ant Nest, Sea of Spores, Tower of Insolence,
  …) sourced from the L2 client's `huntingzone-e.dat`. Each entry
  carries a `(x, y, z)` center anchor and a recommended `minLevel`.
  Spawn rows and NPC / monster / quest detail responses get an
  optional `location` / `primaryLocation` resolved by **nearest
  anchor within a 10000 game-unit 2D threshold** — *not* polygon
  containment. Complementary to `primaryRegion`, not a replacement:
  regions name the death-teleport town, locations name the local
  hunting ground.
- **Hennas** — 180 Symbol Maker engravings with stat changes,
  dye item, price, and class allow-list, joined from upstream
  `hennas.xml` (mechanics) and the L2 client's `hennagrp-e.dat`
  (display name + icon + short label). Embedded on dye-item detail
  (`henna?`) and class detail (`allowedHennas?`); also reachable
  as a standalone catalog at `/hennas` and `/hennas/[symbolId]`.
  Hennas are dye/symbol mechanics — a stat-altering engraving
  consumed at the Symbol Maker, **not** a cosmetic tattoo.
- **Meta endpoints** — known npc types / item types / item grades, with
  counts, for filter dropdowns.

## Where things live

| | |
|---|---|
| `data/datapack/<chronicle>/` | placeholder for upstream **L2 client DAT files** consumed at build time (e.g. `*grp.dat` for icons, `questname-e.dat` for quest journal entries) — untracked |
| `data/manual-fixes/<chronicle>.json` | one file per chronicle, sectioned by entity |
| `data/generated/<chronicle>/` | build output — `items`, `npcs`, `drops`, `spawns`, `recipes`, `skills`, `armor-sets`, `classes`, `spellbooks`, `multisells`, `buylists`, `quests`, `questname`, `regions`, `huntingzones`, `hennas` JSON |
| `scripts/` | `parse-*.ts` per entity, plus `build-data.ts` orchestrator |
| `src/lib/data/` | cached JSON loaders + in-memory indexes |
| `src/lib/api/` | shared route helpers + DTO layer |
| `src/app/api/[chronicle]/...` | route handlers |
| `docs/api.md` | full API reference — start here |
| `docs/api-contract.md` | DTO field-level stability contract |

## Build the dataset

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm build:data                       # defaults to interlude
pnpm build:data --chronicle=interlude # explicit
```

This reads upstream XML and writes
`data/generated/<chronicle>/*.json`. The XML source path lives in
[scripts/chronicle-sources.ts](scripts/chronicle-sources.ts). The datapack
itself is not redistributed in this repo — you need a local checkout.

## Run the API

```bash
pnpm dev                  # development
pnpm build && pnpm start  # production
```

Mounted at `/api/[chronicle]/...`. See **[docs/api.md](docs/api.md)** for
the full reference: endpoints, query params, sort options, response
shapes, and examples.

## Adding a new chronicle

1. Register it in [src/lib/chronicles.ts](src/lib/chronicles.ts) and add a
   runtime data spec in [src/lib/chronicle-config.ts](src/lib/chronicle-config.ts).
2. Add a build-only XML source spec in [scripts/chronicle-sources.ts](scripts/chronicle-sources.ts).
3. Create `data/manual-fixes/<chronicle>.json` with sections for each entity.
4. Run `pnpm build:data --chronicle=<chronicle>`.

No route, loader, parser, or API change is required — every endpoint
becomes available at `/api/<chronicle>/...` automatically.
